The IPFS Community gathered for a virtual meetup last week to celebrate the progress made since the major [go-ipfs 0.5 launch](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-04-28-go-ipfs-0-5-0/) and take a look at where the ecosystem is headed for the duration of 2020.

If you missed it, we’re happy to announce that you can catch up on all of the presentations, from Alex Potsides’ walk through what’s new in [js-ipfs](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-06-08-js-ipfs-0-46/) to special guest Daniel Buchner’s explainer on [Microsoft’s ION](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-06-11-identity-ipfs-ion/). You also won’t want to miss the lightning talks from folks at Textile, AvionDB, Filecoin, IPLD, and more!
