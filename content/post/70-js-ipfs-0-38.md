```

# üî¶ Highlights

## üóëÔ∏è Garbage collection

Support for garbage collection has shipped with `0.38.0`! This means that blocks in your IPFS Repo will be removed when gc is run unless they are pinned.

This is essential for keeping your repo to a manageable size, but must be run manually for the time being.

Use it with the following command:

```console
$ jsipfs repo gc
removed Qmfoo
removed Qmbar
```

To prevent blocks being collected, pin them:

```console
$ jsipfs pin add Qmbaz
pinned Qmbaz recursively
```

## üí¨ Gossipsub enabled by default

Pubsub is now enabled by default with Gossipsub as the default implentation.

More efficient than [Floodsub](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-floodsub), [Gossipsub](https://github.com/ChainSafe/gossipsub-js) creates an overlay on top of the network of nodes which propagates messages to subscribers instead of broadcasting messages to everyone.

Read more about the design at [`libp2p/specs/pubsub/gossipsub`](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/tree/master/pubsub/gossipsub)

## üìõ IPNS support for `ipfs resolve`

You can now resolve [IPNS](https://docs.ipfs.io/guides/concepts/ipns/) names via `ipfs resolve`, what's more the recursive option is now on by default.

```console
$ jsipfs resolve /ipns/Qmqux
/ipfs/Qmgarply
```

# üèó API Changes

* [`ipfs.repo.gc([options])`](https://github.com/ipfs/interface-js-ipfs-core/blob/master/SPEC/REPO.md#repogc) has been added
* [`ipfs.resolve(name, [options])`](https://github.com/ipfs/interface-js-ipfs-core/blob/master/SPEC/MISCELLANEOUS.md#resolve) `options.resolve` now defaults to `true`
