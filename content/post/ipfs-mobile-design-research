The focus of development of IPFS to date has been primarily on desktop and server class hardware. However, the growth of the internet for more than a decade has been almost entirely on mobile devices.

This growth at the furthest edge of the network requires solutions at that edge. As long as the IPFS network remains inaccessable on mobile devices, the value of the network where it matters most is not realized - IPFS will be a step removed from where end users are, its features restricted and stoppable, and its offline use-cases constrained by the application development patterns of centralized networks and services.

In emerging markets and for under-served audiences and marginalized or oppressed peoples the need for data sovereignty, offline-first applications and trustable computing is especially dire, so IPFS should function optimally on the devices used by them in order to serve their use-cases.

## Research + Design

Instead of jumping directly into [implementation](https://github.com/ipfs/roadmap/issues/45), we've initiated a grant to research the existing work, prospective builders and users in order to move forward on well-informed ground, and provide the IPFS and broader P2P and dweb communities with findings and resources to support their efforts in  mobile. This resulted in the IPFS Mobile Design Guidelines project.

The IPFS Mobile Design Guidelines work began in early March 2020 with a research phase investigating mobile internet and cloud service use as well as P2P and IPFS, including wider mobile sharing and receiving workflows. The guidelines research is the beginning of an open body of design research intended to serve the community and inform efforts to use IPFS in mobile applications, and to use mobile devices to build resilient networks that serve the people holding them.

## Methodology

The overall project has two programmes of work. The first is primary research and synthesis, and the second is the development and publication of tools for designers, implementors and builders. The primary research phase is now in progress. It consists of qualitative interviews with three cohorts, landscape surveys of technology and interaction methods, secondary research to produce findings to be used in the next phase. This research phase informs the second phase which will include design recommendations for the implementation and use of IPFS on mobile, including the enumeration of use cases, the design of interaction patterns and interface components - all of which will be shared in a single publication.

## Interviews

Research interviews have been split between three cohorts, the first of which are Experts. Experts are people who’ve worked on IPFS or similar technologies and have a great deal of technical and top-level insights and experience in developing P2P technologies for users.

Simultaneously, Early Adopters were interviewed to understand in which directions the adoption of IPFS on mobile might or should go. Working on related fields such as blockchain, decentralisation, research, data privacy and security, they were uniquely positioned to give educated opinions and foresight in how to translate the knowledge and developments of experts into what might work for users.

Finally, we’ve begun talking to Potential Users, who are mobile phone users recruited for having had smart phone, P2P and cloud services experience, and are spread between varying geographies and demographics. These future users will help guide the design phase of the Mobile Design Guidelines and the design of features, patterns and standards to enable P2P and IPFS to gain widespread acceptance and adoption.

## Survey Review

The survey reviews will cover current uses and applications of IPFS and P2P in mobile devices. The survey is focused on mobile devices exclusively, and applications which use P2P transports whether native or web apps. It will list use-cases, and identify commonalities and differences in implementations.

## What's Next

As we wrap up the research phase of the Mobile Design Guidelines, we'll share the insights from this phase and kick off work on the next. We're look forward to engage the community in building a better safer internet that works on the devices you're probably reading this on.
